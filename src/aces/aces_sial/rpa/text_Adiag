# I am sticking to old EIG_NONSYMM (modified to use DGEEV instead
# ancient rg). In ACES IV. For RPA we only need the right eigen-vectors
# only. As a result, the ACES III SIP format is good enough. The ACES IV
# format is now allowing both left and right vectors transfered to the
# SIAL code. 

# A_MATRIX_P and  A_MATRIX_M are very small (maximum order is 
# is currently set to maximum subspace dimension 20. Both arrays
# must be static.
